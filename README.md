## What have I learnt this week? ##
This week introduced us to many model thinking. The uses of models, the wisdom heirachy, categorisation models, and how to embrace the one-to-many mindset. 
## What do I 'now know' that I did not before? ##
I now know about the Wisdom of the Crowds (I was about to write cows which would of been a "Freudian Slip"). 
## What insights have I gained? ## 
That our world is complex and that many-model thinking can help us have a better understanding of the world that we live in. I've learnt about the use of REDCAPE in order to help model. I've found this can actually be beneficial in my day to day. I suffer from GAD and it is something that I am working on. REDCAPE is something that I can actually employ to help me navigate my world a little bit better. First if I am stressed I can take a moment to reason with myself, not make assumptions. Then I can try an explain why I am stressed. Then I can choose my design in how I want to tackle what ever it is that is stressing me out. I can communicate what is going on with others around me. Then I can take my thoughts and communicate them with others. I can predict how different paths of action will have different outcomes. Lastly, I can use everything I have learnt and explore my outcomes. Actually put things in place. 
## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed? ##
I am not very good at reading and this course will obviously entail a lot of it. Hence, this is something I will need to work on. 
## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? ## 
That there is a lot of work to be undertaken this semester and I will need to distribute my time well.
## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? ##
Nothing yet.
## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? ##
Wisdom of the Crowds as it is a fun piece of knowldge to know.
